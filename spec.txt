On to the list of functions

1. Import and Process Emay Overnight Pulse Oximetry Data from CSV into a form for reporting
2. Calculate HRV from the Emay Data
3. Calculate Nightly, weekly, and long term tracking reports
4. Export High Density Pulse, SPo2, HRV data to CSV in a format acceptable for Apple Health Import
5. Create Dashboards in a dashboarding appliction like Grafana for quick consumption of data
6. Produce Printable reports for review of Nightly and Weekly Data (RRD or PDF?)
7. Connect with the Data Stored in OSCAR for sleep apnea data
8. Recive Steamed EEG from Muse Headband via Mind Monitor IP socket and connect with Sleep Apena and Pulse ox 
Data
9. Store the data for long term analysis in a Database, Postgres or some time series database

In doing this we will always follow PEP-8 style guide (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
these scripts should be platform agnostic, development will be done on Apple Mac on intel, may run on Arm64 
or X64 Linux devices.
Any server code should be able to run in containers (Re 8,9 above)
The import code should be able to be run in a pipeline or severless function (IE OpenFaas) or triggered by a 
new file being created
All parmeters should be set in a Config File, secrets and passwords should be masked and stored using the 
1Password CLI utility OP
Future Function containers may use the Vault API
